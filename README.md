# GameDecider
GameDecider is a fun and interactive web application built with React to help you and your friends decide what game to play from your collective libraries. 
By logging in with your SteamID, you can compare games, input preferences, and join other users through a party system.
With your parties selection of common games (or manually inputted options) the users can participate in multiple games to determine what games to play.

# Current Planned Features:
- Users can search other user's games lists and compare common games.
- Allow users to login and store their games and preferences such as favorites and ignored games.
- Allow users to join a party together with other logged-in users to compare games with multiple users at once.
